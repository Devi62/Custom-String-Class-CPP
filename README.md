# Custom-String-Class-CPP
## **Project Overview**
This mini project implements a Custom STRING Class in C++ without using the Standard Library std::string  .
The objective of this project is to understand low-level string manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, and operator overloading by building a string class from scratch using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

Features Implemented
 The project includes the following features:
.Default constructor, parameterized constructor, and copy constructor
.Dynamic memory management using new and delete
.Operator overloading for common string operations
.Manual implementation of common string functions without using std::string
.Demonstration of Rule of Three in C++
